When, Where, Who, What
========================================================================================================================
* When: 21. September, 2025
* Where: Online via Google Meet, https://meet.google.com/ows-epme-ixu
* Who: Carsten, Christoph, (Katya missed it, but expressed serious interest)
* What: Kick off meeting, get to know each other, basics

Curriculum Talk
========================================================================================================================

* how about CI for people with specific (psychological) disorders?
  * e.g., autism (those not touch-averse), what could be their benefit
* our shared disliking for jams
  * lack of structure, lack of sensitivity
  * no attention to each other (collective care)
  * lack of group experience (+3 people)
* motivation to do that
  * loyalty ;)
  * motivation for progress, the need for "healthy pressure", kick in the butt
* subjects that keep us busy:
  * definition of term CI?
  * what are its core principles?
  * shared core (lowest common denominator) among different approaches?
* what are the different "sections" of CI?
  * factor analysis to figure out its essence?
    
Misc
========================================================================================================================
* history lesson: the 3 week classes of grand union at oberlin before magnesium
  * visible that indeed, the stand was intentional, with a set goal
* small dance = a (tiny) subset of standing meditation (zhang zhuang)
  * observing it, not doing it
* checkout nita little's resources, insightful

What is CI?
========================================================================================================================
* what is CI? (yet again ;)
  * historically: a duet dance form, supporting each other
  * but actually not a dance, more a movement form
  * christoph's personal goal: to break CI free from dance (and hedonistic pleasures)
* what is CI? question for 50 years unanswered
  * let's get closer to it, step by step, and revise as we go along
  * include the "side dishes", be open for different approaches
* carsten's approach for essence/branches:
  * find essential principles, write on post-its
  * rearrange post-its, group them, find branches
* clear differentiation of beginner-master
  * rules as beginner adhered, broken as master (voluntarily, know the risks)
  * the essence, independent from stage of development (beginner/master)

Falling
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* core: falling as the engine for movement
  * also: being off-balance; non-directed movement
  * in new-school CI not taught anymore; just acrobatic lifts
* falling is NOT essential; see "contact at 10th and 2nd"
  * exploring, researching, open curiosity
  * => "a practical research into PHYSICS", embodied experience > theoretical study
  * like a scientist: to do, to try; independent whether it works or not, both is success
    * not necessarily functional or aesthetical pleasing movements
  * improvisation, to not know whether it will work, to be in the moment

Embodied Philosophy
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* less about falling, less about sensation of surprise; a means to reach intentionlessness
* like taijiquan: to be aligned with nature (natural forces, physics)
  * manipulation: forcing, intention, will-full, ... violating principles
* CI as meditation practice, thus sharing spiritual-philosophical intentionlessness
  * to observe without interfering, not wanting, being aligned with nature
    * curiously, being interested, in what happens now; surprise, to fall into it
    * to reach that certain state
    * the opposite of composing movement blocks/techniques
  * falling, a way to achieve it; in standing, walking, and moving
  * christoph's background in martial arts (taijiquan, aikido), filters, not being able to see CI
    * taijiquan, daoism in movement; aikido/tea-ceremony, zen in practice
    * CI, just yet another taijiquan for him? zen in movement, like bow-shooting? calligraphy?
* there are guiding principles (a frame; contact, fall, weight), but movement is happening "by itself"
  * falling, throwing (a body part), dysbalance,... leading to intentionless movements
  * the ultimate intentionlessness: the other surprisingly taking away my balance (surprise, alive, playful)
  * don't teach it to a group, it's a spice (like grabing) requiring skill and knowing each other well (each other's skill and also inter-personally, a strong bond)
* aikido, more than (irrelevant) rolls => a zen attitude of intentionlessness
  * intentionlessness, willinglessness, non-forcing
  * the essence, not knowing, not forcing; both relevant for CI and aikido
  * rolling, falling, off-balance, ((survival)reflexes) ... a way to reach that state
  * also very risky though; thus new-school, a necessary evolution?
    * can we reach that (zen-)state without (risky) old-school behavior? without falling, ...
    * a beginner, usually very big; a master, often small; is a small fall sufficient?
    * nancy's solo: full essence of CI; very small falls, investigative, curious
  * having lots of bruises, not a sign of a competent contacter; more like a incompetent beginner
