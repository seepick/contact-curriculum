Freiburg CI Festival, 21-27 August 2025 \
https://contactfestival.de \
Sunday noon, right after lunch, a voluntary "table talk"

Assignment - A Roleplay
========================================================================================================================
* imagine you are a leading expert in the field of CI
* imagine your super rich government has granted a huge budget to setup a CI university
* imagine you are being asked to design a curriculum what such a study would look like
* it's not about whether it's a good/bad idea (meta-discussion)
  * just consider the possibility and go along with it, and freely brainstorm (not evaluating/discussing any idea)

Format
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* sit in a circle with some people (each topic and sharing is timeboxed!)
* name round + intention to join/doing this
* brainstorm rough aspects/topics/areas to consider
* pick top topics and give each X minutes
    * each person can share in a round about this specific topic
    * at end, do an open mic/discussion
* big open mic at end
* closing round: how was that/lessons learned/most interesting
    
Group Brainstorms
========================================================================================================================

The following mind map is a visual representation of the following 4 group brainstorms we did during the table talk.

Christoph's Upfront Solo Brainstorm
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* level system, staged/phased approach (not all same)
* skills
  * body awareness
  * lifts (hips, shoulders)
  * floorwork
    * rolls, tabletop
  * solo
  * meditation
    * breathing
    * inwards
    * mindfulness (lie, stand, walk)
* attitude: patience, slow, still, listening, aware, focused, open, curious
* principles: ground, weight, PoC
* bachelor - master
  * bachelor = core, basics, common denominator
  * master = specialization
    * research, dance, acrobat, therapy, social (community, activism), pers.dev., ... custom?!
* theory
  * history (of CI, initiation, development; dance/art/sports/movement in general)
  * write essays; conduct presentations (give grades/points, student feedback)
  * books to be read
  * reflecting work; find own path
  * philosophy/spirituality
    * critical/independent thinking
    * zen, dao (confucianism?)
  * medical, biology, anatomy, physiology
  * physics, (bio)mechanics
* social: vocabulary, feedback, group, community
* exam:
  * video recording of practice (evaluated); performance?
  * paired up with teacher to directly experiential evaluate skill
  * objective criteria needed! (what's a good contact improviser?)
    * check principles
  * written
* subjects: free (anything) and optional ones (catalogue to choose from)
  * minimum amount of each "group/category"
* others
  * martial arts, wrestling
  * somatic/bodywork
  * feldenkrais
  * pilates (isolation)

    * aerial (upside down, fear falling)

Other Notes 
========================================================================================================================
* CI branches/archetypes (researcher, dancer, acrobat) reflected in university specialization (master/bachelor)
* breaking with traditions
    * only when you know it, then you can break with it
    * be consciously aware of it
    * be transparent about it
* hierarchy, yes/no?
    * leader is suggesting, not dictating, and it IS there in CI, for short moments
    * institutions, danger of power abuse, destroying individuum
    * ... see conference where podium discussion led to nowhere because lack of structure... some things require hierarchy/structure, some can do (better) without. be specific, not generalized!
* CI university is not the only way of doing CI, just to be an "ordinary practitioner" (as most of us are these days; non-professionals) is enough
* post-mortem insight: leave emotions out of discourse
    * yet create space afterwards for "cleanup" (reconciliation, "healing"); facilitator mediating
