# Contact Improvisation Curriculum

An attempt to create a formal curriculum for the art-sport movement research practice called [Contact Improvisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_improvisation), or short, CI.

Its creation is collaborative, and its use is free of any charge or copyright claims (do with it whatever you want; free as in free beer), allowing educational institutes to use it as a starting point.

## Origin

The idea started at the [Freiburg Festival 2025](https://contactfestival.de) in the context of a so-called _Table Talk_ initiated by Christoph Pickl which was attended by approximately a dozen people to contemplate about how a University study for CI would look like.

## Goal

To systemize CI in a formal way, so that it could theoretically even be offered as a university study.
Think of a list of relevant subjects, grading schemes, objective performance criteria, master specializations, theoretical education, and specific difficulties which might arise trying to formalize something that inherently doesn't want to be formalized.

Doing so while being aware that initially it was not intended to be strictly defined (and even trademarked), to leave it as an open process, only held together by the communication platform [Contact Quarterly](https://contactquarterly.com).

## Collaboration

On the one hand, we have regular, occurring **online video calls** to discuss further content.

On the other hand we use a good, old [forum](https://contactcurriculum.freeforums.net) to keep in touch with each other, discuss topics, and having it persisted for the future. To post content, you need to receive a **registration invitation** and be approved by an admin.

Via this GitHub repository, you can (more or less) easily contribute content (add/edit/delete) by creating a so-called [pull request](https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/beginners-guide-to-github-creating-a-pull-request/).
