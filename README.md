# Contact Curriculum

An attempt to create a formal curriculum for the art-sport [Contact Improvisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_improvisation) (short: CI).
Its creation is collaborative (group meetings, pull requests), and its use is free of any copyright claims (do with it whatever you want).

## Origin

The idea started at the [Freiburg Festival 2025](https://contactfestival.de) in the context of a so-called _Table Talk_ initiated by Christoph Pickl which was attended by approximately a dozen people.

## Goal

To systemize CI in a formal way, so that it could theoretically even be offered as a university study.
Think of a list of relevant subjects, grading schemes, objective performance criteria, master specializations, theoretical education, and specific difficulties which might arise trying to formalize something that inherently doesn't want to be formalized.

Doing so while being aware that initially it was not intended to be strictly defined (and even trademarked), to leave it as an open process, only held together by the communication platform [Contact Quarterly](https://contactquarterly.com).

## Contribution

Besides this repository, which you can contribute to by creating a [Pull Request](https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/beginners-guide-to-github-creating-a-pull-request/), we have **regular online meetings** where we discuss anything we seem relevant.
