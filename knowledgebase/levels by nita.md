Absolute Beginner
========================================================================================================================
Needs no explanation.

Advanced Beginner
========================================================================================================================
* Is awakening to the following ideas and is still a beginner...
* Is comfortable meeting a **variety** of body-minds in a duet
* Can **protect** themselves
  * Can physically deflecting weight
  * Can verbally say "**No**" (potential injury, or any other reason)
* Is able to monitor their level of **focus** in relations to the speed of the action and the needs of the physical relationships
  * They recognize the need to move at the **speed** of their **attention** – and can engage this way from time to time
* Has **rolling** skills that allow the legs to function separately; able to find **spirals**
* Can begin to **pour weight** from body parts into the floor
* Is capable of giving a variety of **percentages of weight** to their partner
* Is capable of "hearing" a physical "no" and can **redirect** their **flow** without stopping the movement
* Easily engages in single **point of contact** flow around bodies meeting in touch – without needing to jump the point of contact
  * Can follow through or replace the point of contact
* Is exploring modes of **falling**
* Rises to meet their partner's weight
* Is capable of seeing while in motion with **diffuse focus** – redistributing the balance of sensory dominance
* Engages in the world **proprioceptively** without visual dominance
* Is able to find many physical orientations to their partner
* Understands and avoids physical **manipulation**
* Respects their partner’s independence and **agency**
* Has 360-degree **spatial awareness** some of the time

Intermediate
========================================================================================================================
* No longer seeks encounters that depend on **equivalence** and sameness
* Moves at the **speed** of their **attention** most of the time
  * Notices when they move faster than their attention
* Understands states of **flow**
  * Can find various modes of physical organization and movement to potentiate **consistent engagement** with their partner
* Is becoming capable of **attending** to their partner's **needs** as well as their own
  * Attends to their partner's mode and speed of attention
* Is **responsive** to their partner's **communication**
* Is capable of shifting **weight** anywhere onto **surfaces** (bodies, floors, objects) with control
* Has **falling** skills including falling together with another person without thinking about it
* Has control of their **pelvis** and takes responsibility for it
  * Can engage pelvis to pelvis contact
* Understands that **balance** is dynamic and that counter-extension supports balance
* Begins to experience the **floor beneath** their partner's body
  * So that the path of weight exchange and support is physically recognized and utilized
* Begins to understand and practice ongoing states of **readiness**
* Has **tonal** capacities and beginning musicality
* Is comfortable with **inversions** and utilizes the weight of the head, freeing the visual field
* Is capable and comfortable moving throughout **spherical space**, without looking visually at where they are going
* Knows their forward moving edge and is attentive to their spatial pathways extending into space before the material form arrives
* Understands that the material is physical but also that the **mental** has a kind of physicality while not being material
  * Is learning to move their attentional physicality – touching the world
* Is in a state of **communication** with their partner/s
* Is able to engage in a duet and a **trio**
* May occasionally engage their capacity to **play**
* Is comfortable with **solos**
* Shows capacities to move **co-creatively**
* Has 360 **spatial awareness** most of the time


Advanced
========================================================================================================================
* Is able to consistently keep their partner's **well-being** in mind
* Has **creative** capacity in their solo movement and partnered relations
* Understands and experiences their **time** practices – chunky time to thin slicing
* Their physical relations hold a gamut of modalities ruled by their space/time practices from reflexive action to states of communion
* Can engage pelvis to pelvis contact through distal points of touch
* Consistently engages in physical **communication** as they build movements co-creatively
* Is **attentional**, tracking their own and their partner’s attention
* Is able to **fall** in any direction
* Has **touch** that adheres to their partner
  * And touch that travels through their partner: fascial level touch
* Capable of acting through a variety of states of **awareness and attention** – understands states

The following are dependent upon other physical/attentional skills and are not to be engaged until communication flexibility and capacities are in place.

* Plays together with their partner throughout the dynamics of **relationship** on levels that may include informed acts of power
  * Dominance to surrender, acts of concurrence and accord, concession and refusal, parallel play, and dynamic range of states of mutual flow and dissonance
* Always acts with communication and **agreement** - knows the limits of play
* Moves from movement **principles** rather than defined pathways
* Moves in states of **readiness** at all times - expecting the unexpected

Teacher level
========================================================================================================================
* Understands that the **body is a mind** just as the mind is a body
* Creates milieux of **safety and care** and identifies lack of care where it exists
* Understands how to **create states**, especially learning states, trance states, and the states of relational and material entanglement
  * Can identify **boundaries** when they limit states
* Embodies **curiosity** within the practice and within lived experience
* Thinks through the movement on **theoretical and practical** levels
* Understands what a **principle** is and can locate a principle(s) within a skill
  * Can move principles over skills
* Can walk into class and begin at the beginning as a beginner - has a **beginners mind**
* Instills **self-trust** in students
  * Understands that the point of trust is for the student to have confidence in themselves
  * Teachers are able to **take themselves out** of the equation
* Are training their ability to put **experience into words**
  * Notice the words they use with **specificity**
* Can identify and avoid words that have too many meanings to be used **clearly**
* Able to identify physical physics and have a working knowledge of Newtonian **physics** as motion and felt movement
* Teach from **experience** and not belief
* Can identify and address time practices, space practices and attentional practices
* Has physical access to all available **body parts** and can engage them uniquely in the practice
* Trusts themselves and realizes there is **always somewhere to go**
* Can both set limits and **break limits**
* Acts honorably with **respect to differences** in all its forms
