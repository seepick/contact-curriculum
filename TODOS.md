* use CI branches/archetypes as template for criteria
  * CI core (bachelor) is everything we share in common, common denominator
    * specializations (masters), dance/acrobat/therapist/researcher...
  * for each, different values, skills, attitudes,... important
    * yet, all same (small) core. eg, values we dont share in common, dont belong in core but a branch.
* find curriculum from universities use as template (multi years, subjects plus description, ECTS points, ...)
