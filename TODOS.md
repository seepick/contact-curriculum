* use CI branches/archetypes as template for criteria
  * CI core (bachelor) is everything we share in common, common denominator
    * specializations (masters), dance/acrobat/therapist/researcher...
  * for each, different values, skills, attitudes,... important
    * yet, all same (small) core. eg, values we dont share in common, dont belong in core but a branch.
* find curriculum from universities use as template (multi years, subjects plus description, ECTS points, ...)
* how to organize/format/structure
  * online meetings?
  * documents/notes in GitHub?
  * outcomes/results/decisions?
  * use [delphi method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_method)?
* who want to participate how
* define goal/vision/mission/target/direction (why are we doing this, motivation)
* distribute workload according to ... branches, e.g.: dance, research, acrobat, spiritual, political, therapy
